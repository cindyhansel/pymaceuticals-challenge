Challenge for Module 5

- The Study:

This analysis is for a new pharmaceutical company called Pymaceuticals. The task was to analyze data from a recent animal screening. In particular, potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, were administered on mice and observed over a 45-day period. Tumor volume was a key observation point.

The purpose of this screening was to compare the performance of Capomulin, the companyâ€™s drug of interest, against other treatment regimens. For this reason, data of Capomulin was pulled out and observed with a bit more detail.

In this study, 249 mice were treated and observed and 10 different drug regimens were administered. There were close to the same number of males and females in this application. One of the mice was eliminated in the analysis because of mismatching data.
